Conclusion:

The overall impact on the ridership numbers and destination locations reasonably shifted.  Entertainment locations lost numbers while the hospital locations increased.

An unexpected shift occurred with Undeclared gender being the most common rider in 2021.  Male ridership in that same period decreased.  Further review of 2021 data in the coming months would be required to see if the trend holds and present explanations.  

Actionable takeaways: 

Usage in the timeframe between Midnight to 6 a.m. is far less than usage during daytime hours.  Maintenace at stations and on the bikes themselves should occur during these hours to minimize interruption to service.  

Casual ridership should start increasing in the near future.  Need to increase visability of the bikes as a refesher to those in the area that the bikes are available for use.
